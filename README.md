## Description

A quality README with information about a project is important for other developers/users/viewers to know how to view and use your application.
This command-line application utilizes Nodejs and Inquirer to generate a README.md file which is populated with your project information.
The generator will prompt you for the necessary items, and notify that your README was created when the process is complete.

## Technologies

- NodeJS
- Inquirer

## Installation

Clone the repository and open it in your preferred code editor.
Navigate to the root folder in your command-line and run 'npm i' to install dependencies.

## Usage

After installation, run 'node index.js' in the command-line to access the prompts and start the generator.
When the prompts are complete, the generator will notify you that your README was created.
The file will appear in the application folder with the information you entered.

The README can then be saved, modified, moved, copied, etc. at your liesure!
